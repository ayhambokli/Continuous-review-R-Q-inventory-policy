#Continuous-review-R-Q-inventory-policy under stochastic demand and Lead time using Python

Transfer the mathematical models into Python, taking into account different scenarios of uncertainty, 
to determine the optimal reorder point and quantity 


this example will not only focus on the mathematical model for inventory policy under continuous review (R, Q) policy. under different scenarios deterministic model and also presenting the idea of the stochastic model with stochastic demand and stochastic lead time with taking into confederation the safety stock and back order cost, but also will provide a numerical example using python programming language to help with comparison and understanding the differences with those model with numbers.
